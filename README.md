# About Listosity
> A user-friendly mobile app designed to help you easily create and manage lists for various purposes. Whether you need a shopping list, to-do list, travel itinerary, or any other kind of checklist, Listosity has got you covered.
## Introduction
**Listosity** was built from scratch and most assets were provided to me from a Udemy Course (Found [Here](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-swift-build-a-to-do-list-app/)).
I made use of a UITableViewController to display tasks, and applyed MVC and Dependency Injection to ensure separation of concerns. Storing the tasks is possible in this app as well.
